"""
Terminal stdout capture — rolling buffer of everything written to stdout
before an exception is raised. Passed to the LLM so it can see print()
output, progress messages, and partial results that preceded the error.

Only stdout is captured — NOT stderr. Excluding stderr prevents the Python
traceback (written to stderr by the default excepthook) from appearing a
second time in the LLM's "Terminal Output" section.

The tee wrapper forwards writes to the original stream unchanged, so the
user sees their output normally. In parallel, each completed line is appended
to a bounded deque — old lines are dropped so memory stays flat.
